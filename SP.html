                    <strong>Singapore Polytechnic</strong> was established in 1954 and is the first and
                    oldest polytechnic in Singapore.<br />
                    Over the years, the campus has gone through many changes to be what it is today.
                <ul>
                    <li>SP has <strong>4</strong> certified <strong>Green Mark Platinum Buildings</strong>

                                "The first solar photovoltaics recycling line is being piloted at SP. The system
                                involves a
                                machine to take apart solar panels, so its components - including precious materials
                                like
                                silver and glass - can be recycled. It has a target recycling capacity of 80 panels a
                                day
                                and a recovery rate of up to 95%. Dr Thong Ta Xuan, Senior Research Scientist from TIE
                                was
                                interviewed. The Polytechnic has also established two laboratories - SP-Sembcorp Solar

                                Research Lab and SP-CHINT Smart Electrical Power Training Laboratory to enhance research
                                and
                                development in the field of solar energy." </cite> <strong> - SP (01 Nov 2022)</strong>
